# React-Essentials-Finished

Informative SPA on React with some dynamic/interactive content

This is a product of an educational method with the guidance of Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. It is not entirely my work.

!! IMPORTANT !!
If you are using a local platform (such as VS Code), you would have to type in the following commands in the terminal, before running the code.

1) npm install
2) npm run dev
